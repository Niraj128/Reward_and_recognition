I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention an urgent matter concerning one of our valued merchants, Baby Bell.

Unfortunately, Baby Bell has been experiencing persistent service issues with their POS machine, despite multiple visits from our dedicated engineer. The merchant's frustration has reached a boiling point, and they have requested the de-installation of their current POS machine.

Understanding the significance of retaining Baby Bell , I requested them to give us one more chance to rectify the situation. To regain their trust and resolve the ongoing issues, I kindly request your assistance in replacing their existing POS machine with a new one.

Merchant Name: Baby Bell
POS ID: 867114

Please let me know how we can proceed with the replacement process and if there are any further details or actions required from my end. Your urgent attention in resolving this issue would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your understanding and support in handling this matter swiftly.

Hi Suresh Sir,



I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to bring to your attention the issue regarding our chargers. We need to reconfirm if any of them have physical damage or are not working properly.



If we find any chargers with physical damage, we will replace them. However, please note that this replacement will be done on a chargeable basis.



I kindly request you to please have a thorough check of all the chargers and inform us of any damages or malfunctions. This will help us ensure that we have a complete and functional set of chargers.



Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.

Hi Suresh Sir,



I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to bring to your attention the issue regarding our chargers. We need to reconfirm if any of them have physical damage or are not working properly.



If we find any chargers with physical damage, we will replace them. However, please note that this replacement will be done on a chargeable basis.



I kindly request you to please have a thorough check of all the chargers and inform us of any damages or malfunctions. This will help us ensure that we have a complete and functional set of chargers.



Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.

This is to inform you that it has been a while since we are facing issues
with both of our Pine labs EDC machines. The issues faced are as follows-

 

EDC machine: 1 (TID- 42523873)

The machine is not getting charged. Even after putting the machine on charge
early in the morning, it is not getting charged properly. Even the battery
back-up is extremely low, because of this our customer has to wait if the
battery dies in between the transaction.

While taking UPI payments, the money is getting debited from customer's
account and it is not reaching our account. After checking the status of
transaction, money is getting credited back to customers account. This is
also creating a lot of confusion and because of this reason our billing time
has increased.

 

 

EDC machine: 2 (CID-2282751)

There is some issue with the machine because of which it is not getting
charged at all. To turn on the machine, it has to be kept on charging mode
in order to take payments and before getting the payment confirmation in the
machine it shuts down automatically. We are also not able to print
settlement because of this same issue.

 

 

It is my humble request, kindly align a technician on priority basis and
change the machines if required as it is impacting our customer experience.
I am hoping for a quick response. Please do the needful.

 

Thanks & Regards

Sumit Patni
